Next up – earnings season kicks off.The S&P 500 index advanced a steady 0.7% on Wednesday as money managers were eager to buy at the top and push to a new one. Underpinning the rushed momentum was the latest inflation reading – June’s consumer-price index arrived at a cool 3% annual pace, beating a 3.1% forecast and above May’s 4.0%.”You’re just too good to be true,” investors were probably softly crooning on their way home after the S&P 500 notched a high unseen since April 2022. And for a couple of good reasons: June was the 12th month of consumer-price declines and a 3.0% rate was the best clip in two years.The S&P 500’s gains were complemented by similar advances in the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones. The tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.1% on the day, while the 30-stock Dow climbed a moderate 0.2%.

The three banking giants, usually first to deploy quarterly figures, will report on Friday. PepsiCo, BlackRock, Delta Air Lines, and UnitedHealth are also in this week’s batch.The third quarter hasn’t been anything like the blowout second trimester, at least so far.

June’s scorching-hot ADP private-sector jobs number arrived at a whopping 497,000 – a record unseen since July 2022. What does this mean for today’s jobs report?Yesterday’s lofty data doesn’t mean we’ll see well over half a million jobs created. US companies did see a massive inflow of workers last month, but that labor-market gauge is often unreliable and more prone to swings and misses than the official payrolls report that is due today.Today’s jobs data is expected to show 240,000 new hires were added to the labor market in June. The estimate is a sizable downgrade than May’s 339,000 new jobs created. In any case, robust jobs data is a strong indicator that the Federal Reserve may move rates higher in its July 25-26 meeting.Illustration by TradingView"

Consumer confidence rose in June to 109.7 – a figure last seen in January 2022. In other words, Americans aren’t too scared about the state of the economy and can afford to spend more than usual.In that context, the other two stock benchmarks - the Dow Jones and the tech-dense Nasdaq Composite also powered forward. The 30-stock blue-chip index added a moderate 0.6% gain, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.6% led higher by beaten-down tech shares.In individual stocks, Apple notched a fresh all-time high and is just some $40bn away from topping a $3tn valuation.

The naysayers, realists, or whatever you want to call them, aren’t buying it. In fact, they’re sitting on top of $1tn in short interest – the shares sold short and not yet covered. The amount of cash is equal to 5% of all shares traded in the US stock market.The broad-based equity index is up about 15% in 2023 and is floating at a 14-month high. Short sellers such as hedge funds, institutional investors (and you?) are getting hammered out there, having incurred roughly $120bn in losses for the year.Top-catchers are not uncommon during times of uncertainty.

In its sixth consecutive day of gains, the broad-based average added 1.22%, finishing the session at 4,425.84. The other two benchmarks moved higher, also closing at record highs for the year.The Dow Jones advanced 1.26% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite popped 1.15% on the day. The strong performance comes a day after the Federal Reserve hit the pause button on its aggressive rate hike campaign. It did, however, signal two more hikes are on the horizon for the year.Further easing the pressure on stocks was fresh economic data.

Just a week after the broad-based average entered a new bull market from its October low, it notched a fresh 52-week high of 4,338.93. What’s behind the rally and can it last?The spectacular run is largely built on an optimistic forecast about the US economy. Recession fears are gradually fading and investors expect upcoming data to cement what’s already being baked into prices – the Fed to hold its rate campaign as inflation fizzles out.Both the Fed and retreating inflation are the main attractions this week. Today’s consumer-price index data, regarded as the main gauge for inflation, is expected to land at 4.1% for May, lower than April’s 4.9%.

In addition, Apple, which gained 1.5%, makes up nearly 10% of the $35tn index.The benchmark average was in a bear market for 248 days before it topped 20% from its October low.

The broad-based index tumbled 0.38% to close just 1% shy of securing a 20% gain from its October 2022 low. The Dow finished the session in the green, while a tech stock sell-off dragged the Nasdaq under the flatline.Global efforts to boost interest rates ended up dousing out the market’s enthusiasm. Just a day after the Reserve Bank of Australia raised its policy rate to 4.1%, the Bank of Canada threw a curve ball with a 0.25% rate hike to a 22-year high of 4.75%, against expectations for a pause.US central bankers meet up on June 13-14 to decide whether it’s a good idea to lift rates further above the 5% to 5.25% threshold.

The US House of Representatives passed yesterday the keenly-watched debt ceiling bill, taking a huge step to avert an unprecedented government default. The debt-limit package was passed with 314-117 votes in favor.In pre-market trading today, the S&P 500 was up just over 0.20%. Its two peers, however, were floating just around the flatline as investors are now getting anxious over the second hurdle for the debt ceiling agreement. After the House, the lower chamber of Congress, passed the bill, the upper chamber is next.The bipartisan bill is headed to the Senate by the end of the week. A pass will raise the US $31.4tn debt ceiling for two years. Will US policymakers need to go through the same motion in two years? Perhaps. The current pact is essentially a debt deal that doesn’t deal with debt. Rather, it piles on more debt with no end to massive deficits in sight.Illustration by TradingView"

With no resolution yet in sight, money managers shifted to a risk-averse stance, leading the broad-based stock average lower by 1.12% on the day. Futures on Wednesday were pretty much unchanged.Worries of a potential default are widespread and causing market jitters. But let’s drill down for a second. Firstly, the US government has never tipped over the point of not being able to pay its debt obligations. It has been close, but every time the ceiling has been adjusted accordingly, i.e. lifted to allow more debt to pile.Presently, while a US default is unlikely, investors prefer to play it safe and follow the old-age adage that “past performance is not indicative of future results.” Still, the reality is that if Capitol Hill does not strike a debt-ceiling deal by June 1, the US government will default on its debt obligations for the first time in history.Maxim Hopman / Unsplash"

Dec 152022,"Highest level in 15 yearsThe Fed isn’t backing down in its war against inflation, and its latest move marks a worrying milestone.The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by half a percentage point yesterday, taking its benchmark interest rate to the highest level seen in 15 years. It's a sign that despite the progress being made, there’s still much work to be done to bring inflation down to manageable levels. On the plus side, it has broken what was the most aggressive rate hike streak since the 1980s, by being the first half point hike after four consecutive three-quarter point hikes. That’s what’s caused markets to react less negatively to this hike than the previous four. As for what’s next, it’s looking like 2023 will continue to bring problems, with the Fed predicting the unemployment rate to reach 4.6% next year compared to its current rate of 3.7%. Although so far the Fed’s strategy has been working (albeit slowly), with the core CPI rate now sitting at 6% – it’s lowest level since December last year.AgnosticPreachersKid / Wikimedia Commons"

November’s nonfarm payrolls rose over 263k, well above estimates for 200k, together with a 0.6% MoM increase in hourly earnings (double what was expected) and a flat unemployment rate of 3.7%.Wage increases will exacerbate any supply/demand imbalances in the labor market and contribute to stubbornly high inflation, particularly in the services sector where wages are a notable cost factor – services inflation is also half of the core personal consumption expenditures index (PCE), which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.It all means J-Pow’s dovish pivot could have to wait a few more months despite the Fed Chair saying the pace of tightening could ease slightly in December – strong wages are only good when inflation is near that 2% goal.

The tech-driven Nasdaq, which has taken a 27% beating since the start of the year, saw even larger gains of 4.58% yesterday. Based on his comments, experts now predict that a 50 bps rate hike is likely at the next meeting in two weeks time.The good news came with a warning however, as Powell said that borrowing costs will need to remain restrictive for some time to come. He also warned that existing rate hikes won’t be reversed any time soon. Long story short – there’s still a difficult road ahead, but we might just be over the hump. Federalreserve/ Flickr"
Nov 242022,"A reason to celebrateThe Fed has brought the celebration to Thanksgiving this year with signals that their hawkish strategy might be eased. The Federal Reserve released their meeting minutes on Wednesday, and the comments indicate that future rate hikes could be beginning their dovish pivot – though that came with comments that indicated a recession will certainly hit in 2023. But we kinda knew that already. Market experts are now largely expecting only a 50bps hike in December after four straight hikes of 75bps. There was also a bunch of economic data released yesterday pointing to the potential for lower hikes on the way. US business activity contracted for the fifth month in a row, and the US Manufacturing PMI also dropped down to 47.6 – its first drop since the start of the pandemic. Many US equities and indices are enjoying a week in the green so far amid a shortened trading week, with the overall sentiment looking positive before the holidays. Investors are hoping all this could mean that the end of this brutal bear market could be approaching.Maryam Sicard / Unsplash"
Nov 112022,"We’ll take what we can getThe market’s been drowning in dire earnings reports and midterms-induced anxiety so investors grab onto bullish CPI news like it's the last life raft on the Titanic.Thursday was a good day, and it all started with CPI data, which ICYMI showed that inflation has at last begun to cool and is down to its lowest level since January – annual consumer price growth slowed to 7.7%, less than the 8% expected by analysts and easing from its four-decade high. It means the Fed has space to downshift from its aggressive rate hikes, though whether the agency will make use of that space is still to be seen. While this data is a step in the right direction, its levels remain way above what the Fed deems acceptable and speeches from various Fed governors yesterday indicate that the hawkishness ain’t over yet. The market had its best day in over two years. The S&P 500 jumped 5.5%, the Nasdaq lifted 7.5%, the Dow lifted 3.7% and the Russell 2K rallied 6.1%. The dollar index, on the other hand, has seen a massive change in trend and sentiment and suffered its worst day of trading since exiting the financial crisis in 2009, made worse by plummeting bond prices.

Nov 032022,"Hikes wreak havocOnce again the Federal Reserve has put a dampener on economic outlooks, with yet another hike in interest rates tightening purse strings.The Fed has raised interest rates by 75bps to fight inflation. The move represents the sixth rate hike in a row which is the sharpest increase seen since the 1980’s, with any hope that the tension might be wearing off now dashed.Major indexes have been feeling the weight of the decision. The S&P 500 dropped by 2.29% on the news, while the Dow saw losses of 1.24%. The Nasdaq, a particularly prospective index, was hit especially badly with losses of 3.41%. Chairman Jerome Powell’s been staking a rock-steady stance on the battle against inflation. Although the hikes were largely telegraphed, markets have been spooked at suggestions that further hikes of 50bps could be on the way before December. Buckle up, folks. Maxim Hopman / Unsplash"
Oct 312022,"Inflation is still too highWith a few days until November’s rate hike, we just got the last piece of this month’s inflation puzzle and tensions are running hotter than on family game night. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data came out on Friday and there’s a bit to digest here, specifically in terms of what it might mean for Wednesday's rate hike. The PCE reading is a key measure of inflation for the Fed, and the index in September increased 0.5% from August and 5.1% from a year ago. It means inflation is still uncomfortably high but largely within expectations, though the reading does nothing for the dovish rate hike argument. Analysts are firmly expecting another 75bps hike on the way, though there is the chance that the Fed will pivot away from its hiking aggression after that – which many other countries already have. Investors seemed to focus on hope, sending markets rallying to finish the week. All four major indices notched their second week of gains and are firmly on track to close October in the green, with the Dow and its monthly jump of 14% leading the pack. Consumer sentiment also continues to creep up after its summer all-time lows, but Wednesday could change everything. Etienne Martin / Unsplash"
Oct 272022,"Yield curves’ red flagThe equities market and its feel good feeling comes tumbling down on Wednesday as the US Treasury market sets off all sorts of flashing alarms. A classic recession warning is flashing in the US Treasury market. On Wednesday, US government 3-month rates lifted above the yield on 10-year bonds, which is a pretty unusual crossing and is often regarded as one of the most reliable indicators that a recession is coming in the next 6 - 18 months. This indication has successfully forecast past recessions from the last few decades without raising any false alarms, especially those within Fed tightening cycles, but obviously nothing in the world of trading is a sure thing. We are currently in one of the worst Treasury routes in decades, with yields in the US bond market skyrocketing this year along with interest rates.Investors have a bit of a love hate relationship with the market this week. All four major US indices had been on somewhat of a pump earlier this week, logging three sessions of impressive gains that took prices to one-month highs. Wednesday started off looking good, but all four came tumbling down as the reality of a potential recession loomed once again.Zachary Keimig / Unsplash"
Oct 142022,"Back with a vengeanceScorching hot inflation data burns the market, but investors seem used to the heat by now and fire back with an absolute vengeance. Inflation in the US rose more than expected to touch a four-decade high, and the market had a veeeery mixed reaction. Headline CPI rose 0.4% MoM and 8.2% YoY, while core inflation (excluding volatile food and energy prices) lifted 0.6% MoM and 6.6% YoY for the biggest one-month increase in core inflation since August 1982. This cements fears that the Fed has no plans to pivot on its aggressive rate hikes, but at the same time there are those who think CPI is an unreliable inflation reading because of the lag in reporting – one such person is Cathie Wood, who’s made vocal her opinion that the Fed is looking at the wrong metrics to make decisions. What was really interesting to watch though was the market’s reaction. Stocks tanked – hard – following the release. All four major indices fell off a cliff, but shortly after came roaring back to close the day as one of the best of the year, with the SPX enjoying its most impressive intraday comeback since December 2008 on a percentage point basis. Some think investors are looking, others think people were covering their shorts, but either way it was a remarkable reversal.Dylan Calluy / Unsplash"
Oct 102022,"Intuition is a funny thingNonfarm payrolls data is out and whilst the good news might make you think “wohoo” for the economy, it’s not as great as you’d think for the market. Nonfarm payrolls increased 263k for September, coming in short of estimates for 275K, while the unemployment rate was down 3.5% to hit its lowest since 1969. It marks 21 straight months of job growth in the US, which is great in some respects but is the opposite of what the Fed is trying to achieve to lower inflation. Is it another nail in the coffin for a 75bps hike in November? The market’s may think so given all four major US indices finished Friday sharply lower and reversed gains from an earlier bull rally. When labor has the upper hand, workers have more bargaining power – that means upward inflationary pressure bc companies’ costs go up and therefore they raise their prices.The news extended rallies in the dollar and crude oil futures, which had their best week since Feb 2022, though that’s partly because the US plans to release more of its emergency oil supplies to offset OPEC production cuts. The decision comes despite concerns that emergency petroleum reserves are at their lowest levels in almost 40 years.Illustration by TradingView"
Oct 052022,"Is the labor gap closing?As the stock market starts Q4 on an absolute hot streak, we're handed data that shows the first sign of the labor market losing strength.JOLTS data has been released showing that job openings plunged by over a million in August, with available positions now totalling 10.05m and representing a 10% drop from 11.1m in July – coming in well below estimates for 11.1m. Despite the major drop, job openings remain high in relation to workers with the ratio to available workers at 1.7:1. The quits rate also remains elevated, and other measures of labor market stress remain historically low. Tech companies on the other hand are having to cut jobs as their growth slows.The market’s got off to a stellar start to the month. This week, the S&P 500 has gone up 5.7% and enjoyed its biggest two-day rally since March, the NASDAQ is up by 5.5%, the Dow has gained 5.5% and the Russell 2K has rallied 6.6% – but is the change in sentiment here to stay?AbsolutVision / Unsplash"
Oct 032022,"The Fed’s fave measure is upAs the third quarter wraps, US stocks continue to feel under pressure after Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data shows people are still spending but also still paying more. PCE data on Friday showed a MoM increase of 0.6% in August, bringing its YoY reading to 4.9% (vs 4.7% expected) and becoming the latest dataset to prove inflation continues to accelerate. This is the Fed’s preferred inflation metric bc it excludes volatile energy and food prices, and this increase likely means the regulator will remain in tightening mode. The news brought down major indices to mark their third straight quarter of losses and see the worst September in 20 years for the S&P 500 after a 9.34% drop. For the month, the Nasdaq closed down 10.6% as risk assets sold off and left stocks like MSFT and GOOGL at 12-month lows, the Dow dumped 8.84% and the Russell 2K lost 9.37%. Big bad earnings season is nearly here, with a few companies like Nike getting the ball rolling on a worrying note last week. Analysts have been rushing to cut their year-end forecasts in light of, well, everything, as it dawns on them that Q4 will be worse than anyone expected and the R word (recession, duh) gets ushered more fervently.Kurtis Garbutt/ Unsplash"
Sep 282022,"The first decline in 10 yearsThe housing market fun we had during covid is over as prices decline for the first time in a decade, helping the S&P 500 hit fresh lows on Tuesday. National home prices cooled in July at the fastest rate in history, showed data from the S&P Case-Shiller Index on Tuesday – prices are still higher than they were a year ago (for now) but accelerated only 15.8% in July vs 18.1% in June. New home sales managed a small comeback but that’s forecast to drop back down swiftly. Tamping down the housing market is what the Fed wants because it’s so closely linked to consumer spending – if people don't feel financially confident, it’ll drive down their spending and reduce demand, helping cool inflation. But for us, the consumer, it doesn’t feel quite as good and analysts forecast it’ll get worse before it gets better with mortgage rates set to hit 7%. Falling stock markets have wiped out over $9tn in wealth from US households as equities endure a macro tsunami. The S&P 500 hit its lowest level in nearly two years on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs predicts another 2% drop before the end of the year for the index, and BlackRock says the markets haven’t even fully priced in rate hikes yet."
Sep 222022,"Can’t stop, won’t stopFed Chair Jerome Powell says his vows in front of the whole world, pledging to fight inflation for better or worse, for richer or poorer, till rate hikes do them part. J-Pow handed the market yet another 75bps rate hike on Wednesday, an increase that was fairly widely expected given the Fed’s stronger-than-usual wording on the inflation situation and a 0.1% MoM increase in consumer prices in August – it’s the third hike of this size in a row and takes rates to between 3% and 3.25%, the highest in 14 years.Stocks ricocheted around the charts on Wednesday, with all four major US indices selling off and the dollar hitting a fresh 20-year high. J-Pow’s determined to get inflation down to 2% and targeting the labor market and housing will help achieve the Fed’s mandate – it likely means unemployment will go up and house prices will go down, which would leave a mark on risk assets.“The chances of a soft landing are likely to diminish” said the Fed Chair, adding that the agency expects rate hikes to rise at a faster pace and to a higher level than originally hoped – prolly to a range of 4.25%-4.50% by December. JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon agrees, urging lawmakers to prepare for a worst-case scenario."
Sep 052022,"Starting the long weekend earlyIt seems the stock market decided to start its long weekend with a sleepy end to the week, with investors trying to get all the selling out the way so they can chill today. Major US indices popped and dropped on Friday, starting the day on a bullish note before jobs data came out the ruin the fun and lead indices to close their third straight week in the red – the S&P 500 closed last week down 3.29%, the Dow lost 2.99% in the week, the Nasdaq sank 4.02% and the Russell 2K declined 4.74%.August’s job data showed continued strength in the jobs market in a month that’s historically volatile for jobs, with nonfarm payroll data showing the economy added 315k jobs in August, down from 526k in July but still stronger than the 300k expected and well above the pre-pandemic trend – job openings currently outweigh available workers by nearly 2:1. Debt investing is straight up not having a good time rn, with all of this has led the global bonds market to enter its first bear market in a generation – the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Total Return Index of government and investment-grade corporate bonds falling more than 20% from its 2021 peak, the biggest drawdown since its inception in 1990.Mark Basarab / Unsplash"
Aug 292022,"Papa Powell takes the stageIt was all eyes on Jackson Hole last Friday as investors remained focused on monetary policy, and Papa Powell gets people feeling a bit queasy after warning of “some pain” to come.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated his commitment to halting inflation in his speech at Jackson Hole on Friday, warning the Fed expects to continue raising interest rates in a way that will cause “some pain” to the economy. Yeah, cause it’s all been soooo easy breezy up till now… Some were hoping for a dovish pivot from the central bank, but at the same time this news isn’t a real shock to anyone. Powell pledged that the Fed will “use our tools forcefully” and pointed to the lack of enough economic data to suggest a dovish stance is wise despite hints from CPI data that inflation is cooling – the goal is to get inflation back down to 2%. The market was straight up not having a good time on Friday and most major US indices had their worst day since June – the S&P sank 3.37%, the Nasdaq lost 4.1%, the Dow dumped 3.03% and the Russell 2K reversed 3.3%. Traders are currently debating between a 50bps and 75bps hike, with the probability of a half point hike sitting at 51.5% after the speech according to the CME."
Aug 122022,"PPI paints a pretty pictureThe economic news just keeps on coming and investors keep trying to dissect what it means for rate hikes while oil prices hold up the S&P 500. The Producer Price Index saw prices fall for the first time since early pandemic, as wholesale prices in the economy fell 0.5% MoM and 9.8% YoY from a much steeper 11.3% in June. The drop was primarily driven by a decline in energy prices for the month, with US gasoline prices falling below $4 per barrel this week for the first time since March. Better fill those tanks while you can. After starting the day on a positive note, major indices paired earlier gains related to CPI data on Wednesday and closed the day with either muted gains or losses. Bonds sold off on the news and sent yields higher as investors rethink their rate hike expectations – which are pretty much all over the place rn.Major oil producers were leading the S&P 500 on Thursday, thanks to a 2.62% jump in crude oil futures to take its weekly gains to 5.5%, headed up by Devon Energy’s 7.34% increase. Helping that was a forecast from the International Energy Agency, which sees oil demand growing this year, though in contrast OPEC sees oil going into a surplus this year… so that’s nice and clear then.

Aug 082022,"Will this jolt the fed into aggression?Friday’s highly anticipated JOLTS report certainly did what it described: gave the market a shock with an ever-strengthening jobs market that hints rate hikes may not slow after all. The US economy added 528k jobs in July while analysts were optimistically expecting around half of that at 258k jobs, and the unemployment rate dropped to around 3.5% – any early economic data that signaled a softening in the labor market have been proven incorrect and has left people wondering what all this will mean for the Fed. It basically means the central agency has a long road ahead of them, but tbh we knew that already. A strong jobs market is ultimately good for the economy, esp given it’ll drive up wages, but that’s not gonna do much to help the Fed’s goal of weakening demand to tame inflation.It could also mean the end of the market’s recent rally, which saw growth stocks rebound after the Fed hinted last week that they may slow the pace of rate hikes if economic data supports it – which this data doesn’t. The dollar on the other hand, seems rather excited by the news and ended the week on a sharp uptick. Watch the market closely this week to see how it adjusts to the data. Chenyu Guan/ Unsplash"
Jul 282022,"Papa Powell pumps up the marketThe market spends Wednesday afternoon cheering on the Fed’s latest rate hike decision, with J-Pow spurring on the gains with an update on where the agency’s head is at.July’s rate hike officially came in at 75bps, the second hike of that size, a relief for those that got spooked by a red-hot inflation reading a few weeks back and expected 100bps hike to hit. Interest rates are now sitting at 2.25%-2.50%, having been raised aggressively after the Fed’s “transitory” thesis on inflation last year turned out to be v wrong. The aggression could be coming to an end soon though, according to Jerome Powell. He reassured everyone that the agency is aware of rate hikes impact on economic growth, and suggested that they could slow the pace of its hikes in its September meeting as it watches the labor market soften – data dependent, ofc – though they are prepared to push the economy into a recession if need be. Major US indices popped on the better-than-expected news. The S&P 500 lifted 2.62% to its highest price since June 9, the Nasdaq jumped 4.26%, the Russell 2K closed up 2.39%, and the Dow increased 1.37% – but, analysts are warning investors that the market could reverse in the days coming, which is what happened after the last hike. Look first, then leap, peeps.Etienne Martin / Unsplash"
Jul 142022,"He's a 9.1 but he's inflationThe heat of Wednesday’s CPI is too much for major indices to handle and prices buckle, despite their best efforts at staying upbeat. Inflation reached a fresh new 40-year high of 9.1% in June, exceeding expectations for an 8.8% reading and marking the highest levels since 1981. Core CPI, which excludes energy and food prices bc they’re so volatile, decelerated for the third month in a row to come in at 5.9% YoY. It means that the factors the Fed’s policies can impact are falling, but prices it has little control over continue to rocket up.The flaming hot reading led the Treasury yield curve to invert by the most in around 22 years. The 2-year note (which is more sensitive to monetary policy changes) popped by 9 basis points while its 10-year counterpart fell nearly 4 basis points, leading to an increase in the spread of 13bps – yield curve inversions are often seen by analysts as a sign of an oncoming recession. Major US indices gave a good effort at gains but still ended the day down, marking the fourth straight session of losses for most of them. The S&P 500 fell 0.45%, the Nasdaq lost 0.14%, the Dow dumped 0.67%, and the Russell 2K sank 0.12% – investors are clearly trying to stay somewhat positive, but as Wells Fargo’s Michael Schumacher said: “this is a bad number”.

Jul 052022,"Futures are jumpy over economic dataWe hope you’re all nice and rested after the long weekend, and you’re as ready to tackle the week ahead as stock futures seem to be this morning, despite looming economic data. Stock futures are on the rise on Tuesday morning despite all major US indices finishing last week in the red and having their worst H1 in decades. Futures tied to the Dow are up 0.2%, SPX futures are 0.24% higher, and Nasdaq futures are up 0.39% – prices could be taking a page out of European stocks’ book, which started the week on an upbeat note. China tariff talks could be boosting sentiment somewhat. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and China’s Vice Premier Liu He met virtually on Monday to discuss economic sanctions and the possible lifting of tariffs to help stabilize global supply chains. Investors could be thinking that’ll help lift pressure on inflation, but analysts aren’t so sure.Speaking of inflation, it’s a big week for economic data. In a shortened trading week, all eyes are watching for Wednesday’s release of minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting and June jobs report data on Friday – all of which should give us an update on what the next rate hike might look like and prolly bring in a whole bunch of recession theories.

Jul 012022,"The worst half in 50 yearsSo the first half of the year is over, and it’s been a wild ride – we can only hope that you and your portfolio have fared better than the S&P 500 so far.The S&P 500 suffered its worst first half since 1970, and its journey into the red has been shared with other indices. In 2022 to date: the S&P 500 is down 21%, the Nasdaq had its worst first half ever and lost 29%, the Dow has sunk 15%, and the Russell 2K has reversed nearly 25%. But it’s not the worst six months in 50 years, just the worst first half, so there’s that.Core personal consumption expenditure hit 4.7% in May for the slowest rate of inflation since November, meaning that disinflation could finally be rearing its pretty little head. Added to that, one S&P Dow Jones analyst said that a dismal H1 performance doesn’t necessarily mean we’re in for more pain, so the news is not without hope. Tech stocks have been badly hit in the second quarter. Tesla, which only last year reached a trillion-dollar market cap, had its worst quarter since going public; Amazon dropped the most since 2001 at 35%, Alphabet’s 22% loss was its worst since the 2008 crash, and Apple had its worst three months since 2018.

Jun 242022,"Is that a week in the green we see?I spy with my little eye… something beginning with R. And no, this time we’re not talking about a recession.If you guessed recovery, then you got it. Major US indices are well on their way to a week in the green after last week’s painful sell-off, with 7 of 11 sectors closing Thursday on the up. This week, the S&P 500 rose 3.29%, the Nasdaq has lifted 3.83%, the Dow’s gained 2.64%, and the Russell 2K is ahead by 2.76%. Positive news from the country’s largest banks is helping. All of the 34 banks tested have passed the Fed’s latest round of stress tests, which measures lenders’ ability to weather a severe economic downturn – like the one a lot of people think is headed our way. That’s a great sign for the financial health of the country and its biggest institutions – which regulators say are systemically important to the economy – especially given the Fed really upped its game and stress tested for conditions “much more severe than any post-World War II recession”. The economy may have its issues, but this defos seems a good sign. Illustration by TradingView"
Jun 222022,"A recession-proof rally?Major US indices woke up from the long weekend ready to march out of the doldrums despite hearing constant calls for a recession from the barracks. US equities blocked out the haters on Tuesday, with every single sector opening the week in the green. After all closing last week near 18-month lows, the S&P 500 surged 2.45%, the Nasdaq lifted 2.49%, the Dow jumped 2.15%, and the Russell 2K rallied 1.7%. From the look of overnight futures though, the rally may be short-lived. Goldman gave a not-so-bullish update on where they think the economy is heading. The bank thinks there’s a 48% cumulative probability of a recession over the next two years, up significantly from its previous guess of 35%. They are “increasingly concerned that the Fed will feel compelled to respond forcefully to high headline inflation and consumer inflation expectations”. The calls were joined by investor Cathie Wood, who says the Fed is ignoring dangerous recession signals. She called recent rate hikes “draconian”, arguing that economic indicators are flashing red and that the Fed is risking weak economic growth throughout this year. Buckle in, folks.

Jun 162022,"The Fed tries to put out the inflation fireEquities have been burning after an inflation reading last week, so the Fed whips out the extinguisher and turns it all the way up to 1.75%. The Fed hiked rates by 75bps on Wednesday for the third hike of the year, following the latest meeting of the FOMC. The increase is “unusually large” (though not unexpected) and marks the harshest rate hike in 28 years, and takes rates to a range of 1.5% - 1.75% – the highest level since covid hit in March 2020. Major US indices snapped a five-day losing streak to actually rally on Wednesday. The S&P 500 lifted 1.46%, the Nasdaq added 2.49%, the Dow moved up by 1%, and the Russell 2K gained 1.36%. That being said, it’s not unusual for it to take a few days to see a real market reaction to policy news, so keep your eyes peeled for possible volatility.Papa Powell did his best to soothe any fears with a generally optimistic view of the economy. While officials significantly cut their outlook for 2022 economic growth from 2.8% to 1.7%, as well as hinting that another 75bps hike isn’t off the table in July, Powell also said “overall economic activity appears to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter”.Yusuf Onuk / Unsplash"
Jun 132022,"CP-I can see another day in the redMajor US indices have clearly forgotten that contacting an ex is never a good idea, flirting with a bear market once again after taking a fiery shot of CPI data. Wall Street just had its worst week since January thanks to a Friday sell-off. Last week, the S&P 500 lost 5.06% to hit its lowest close since March 2021, the Nasdaq declined 5.7% for its lowest close since November 2020, the Dow dumped 4.58%, and the Russell 2K reversed 4.4%. Inflation continues to put pedal to the metal in May, accelerating 8.6% from a year ago for the highest increase since December 1981, and 1% since last month. On the bright side, core inflation excluding food and energy only rose 6%, but that was still higher than expected and the energy crises ain’t going anywhere fast. The Fed is raising rates this week. Previous forecasts of a half point hike are looking less likely thanks to red hot inflation, which will prolly put the agency under pressure to implement harsher rate hikes of 0.75%. Disappointing earnings forecasts from the likes of Target and Microsoft gave investors the ick last week – so basically, buckle in for the week ahead. Illustration by TradingView"
May 132022,"Papa Powell stays head of the familyAs the Federal Reserve faces an uphill battle with inflation and staving off a recession, it’s voted to keep its chief commander at the helm for another term. Jerome Powell has been voted in for another four years as Fed Chair by pretty much a landslide, clearly having proven himself in his first four years despite being plagued by covid, inflation, rate hikes, and all sorts.It came on the back of April’s producer prices data, which notched their fifth straight month of double-digit MoM increases and came in hotter than expected. CPI data was higher than expected as well, but at least they weren't as hot as last month. Small wins. Market losses slowed their roll, at last. Don’t get us wrong, most indices still declined – the S&P 500 was down 0.13%, the Nasdaq declined 0.18%, the Dow lost 0.33% – but prices saw a recovery in day trading and the losses were less than the last few days.Federalreserve / Flickr"
May 052022,"Stocks get excited for a hikeThe Federal Reserve announces its next rate-hike, and investors seem keen to get some relief from inflation.The Fed implemented its second rate hike of the year, announcing a widely-expected half point hike following the conclusion of its Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday – it’s the biggest increase in 22 years.The agency will also start massively shrinking its balance sheet amid one of the tightest labor markets we’ve seen in a while. This market doesn’t usually take this kind of news well, but inflation and consumer prices are skyhigh and people are excited for that to be addressed – a similar rate hike is expected at the next few meetings. Major US indices all trended upwards on Wednesday. The S&P 500 closed up nearly 3%, the Nasdaq led the pack with a 3.4% jump, the Dow was up 2.8% and the Russell 2K ran ahead by 2.69% – all four have seen gains every day this week, so clearly they wanted to keep the good vibes going after a rocky start to the year.

Apr 132022,"Welcome to the inflation ageThis feels like the theme song of Q1, but here it is: inflation is up, and stocks are down. Most major US indices stumbled over CPI data on Tuesday. The S&P 500 fell 0.34% and is down 2% for the week, the Nasdaq lost 0.36% and is 2.7% lower this week, but the Dow somehow managed a jump of over 2%. Inflation was red-hot, rising 1.2% in March (above estimates) to represent an 8.5% increase YoY. The last time inflation was this high was 16.5 years ago – when Raegan took office. Yikes. As expected, energy saw the biggest CPI increase at 11%, and oil lifted over 5% on Tuesday. Tomorrow will reveal the producer side of things when PPI data comes out, but it’ll probs be along the same lines. Nobody is massively shocked, but it does mean the Fed will more than likely raise interest rates by half a point in May, as opposed to a quarter – and experts are already warning of recession shock.Sharon McCutcheon / Unsplash"

As the Fed tightens its monetary policy and inflation continues to hit consumer spending, BofA said: “‘inflation shock' worsening, 'rates shock' just beginning, 'recession shock' coming"". Sounds ominous. Earnings SZN is on the way, but peeps aren’t feeling very confident. Big banks will be kicking things off this week as per, but are expected to report a decline in earnings from a year ago thanks to the war in Ukraine and tough comparables. The market is also expecting some hot inflation data this week. Strap in folks. Taylor Simpson / Unsplash"
Apr 042022,"The economy holds off on hopeThe US stock markets started Q2 on a sad note despite the labor market roaring back to life. 🔍 Key points:Major US indices were lacking them weekend feels on Friday. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed down around 1.5%, the Russell 2K lost 1%, and the Dow dashed 1.56% – but all four started Monday on a positive note. US unemployment reached a new pandemic low in March, with over 431k jobs in the month to bring the unemployment rate to 3.6% – nearly matching the 3.5% boasted in Feb 2020, which matched a near 50-year low.So what does this week have in store? March’s jobs report posed as a nice prelude to this week’s FOMC meeting minutes, and will likely play a role in any rate hike decisions the Fed makes there on Wednesday. The next one is expected in May, but this will likely whet its appetite for a half point hike instead of a quarter point."
Mar 312022,"SPAC attackUS stocks saw their winning streak come to an end on Wednesday, while the SEC sets its sights on SPACs. 🔍 Key points:Major US indices fell into a funk on Wednesday, marking the first day of the week in the red for most. The S&P 500 sank 0.63%, the Nasdaq lost 1.1%, the Russell 2K fell 1.92%, and the Dow dumped 0.19%. Crude oil was on the rise on Wednesday as a “little progress” came out of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. But, news that Biden is on the verge of releasing a whole ton of oil from US emergency reserves sent Brent Crude down nearly 5% in Thursday morning trading.Elsewhere, the SEC is taking aim at SPACs with a host of new rules that, if enacted, would mark one of the biggest attempts so far to crack down on the popular new market for blank-check companies – which are already struggling through 2022.

Mar 282022,"Another week on Wall StreetWe’re kicking off another week on Wall Street as investors contemplate what upcoming economic data will bring.🔍 Key points:All the major US indices started the week in the red on Monday after a modest rally last week that saw the S&P 500 gain 1.79%, the Dow jump 0.31%, and the Nasdaq pop 2.32% – the Russell 2K was the one hold out, sinking just over 0.3%.The market’s winning streak is at risk this week though as investors await a bunch of economic data. Keep an eye out for Tuesday’s JOLTs report, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) on Wednesday, and Friday’s monthly jobs report. The state of the economy will impact the Fed’s decision on rate hikes in April, and investors are already expecting a half point hike after hawkishness from Fed Chair J-Powell. On the other hand though, another round of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine have started on Monday, and the Ukraine president says he is willing to discuss neutrality.

Mar 212022,"A moody MondayMajor US indices must have woken out of bed on the wrong side this morning, perhaps still exhausted from last week's bull run.🔍 Key points:Major US indices opened in the red on Monday despite Wall Street enjoying its best week since November 2020. The S&P 500 closed last week up 6.16%, the Dow jumped 5.5%, the Nasdaq nabbed gains of 8.41%, and the Russell 2K leaped 5.38%.Energy is one of the few sectors gaining ground on Monday, with oil giant Occidental Petroleum flying over 10% to near a three-year high and oil prices once again flirting with the $110 mark. With 2022’s first rate hike out of the way, all eyes are on Ukraine. Russia’s invasion is showing no signs of going away despite potentially promising peace talks last week. On the plus side though, most major indices have now recovered all invasion-induced losses. Zbynek Burival / Unsplash"
Mar 182022,"Green for St Patrick’s DayWall Street keeps in the spirit of St Patrick on Thursday to trade a sea of green, leaving people to wonder if the worst is over. 🔍 Key points:Most US indices opened Friday in the green for a fourth day. The S&P 500 is on track for its best week since late 2020 with gains of 5.15% so far, the Nasdaq is up over 7% for the week, and the Russell 2K and the Dow (the only one to open in the red today) are ahead 4.4%. It comes despite hawkish comments from a senior Fed official. Governor Waller says “inflation is raging” and thinks that a 0.5% hike might be necessary as the next rate increase (as opposed to the 0.25% people are expecting) as fighting in Ukraine hits commodity prices. Speaking of Ukraine, peace talks are looking positive, which may be helping indices climb out the doldrums – and when we say “positive” we mostly mean they’re still going on at all, which is more than could be said two weeks ago. Although, Western officials are still feeling cautious.Eyestetix Studio / Unsplash"
Mar 162022,"The market breaks up with energy’s bad vibesThe energy market runs out of steam on Tuesday while other major US indices ended the day in the green. 🔍 Key points:It seems to have been the right call given the sea of green they enjoyed. The S&P 500 jumped 2.14% though it also formed the ominous death cross, the Nasdaq nabbed gains of 2.16%, the Dow lifted 1.82%, and the Russell 2K rallied 1.4%. Energy was the only sector that closed the day in the red. Oil ended the day at around $96, its lowest level§ all month. Part of that could be thanks to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who said talks with Russia were starting to sound “realistic”. The market is waiting for big news from the Fed. The central bank is meeting today to make a decision on rates, and is expected to kick things off with a quarter-point rate hike in March as the first of many for 2022. Here’s hoping there are no nasty surprises in store. Li Zhang / Unsplash"
Mar 112022,"What goes up…Major U.S. indices had their fun on Wednesday, but stern CPI data sent prices right back to the red.🔍 Key points:All the big indices slipped on Thursday after rallying the day before. The S&P 500 lost 0.43% and is still in a correction, the Nasdaq stuck around bear territory and got knocked 1.10%, the Dow dumped 0.34%, and the Russell 2K sank 0.23%. The inflation situation is getting worse and worse. CPI data reached a fresh new 40-year high, rising 7.9% in February from the same time last year – and that’s not even taking into account the hike in oil and gas since Russia invaded Ukraine. It may not have been a huge shock, but it will defos put pressure on monetary tightening. Investors’ hopes for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine were dashed. A first round of talks between the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia gave people (albeit, very faint) hope on Wednesday, but apparently there was no progress made on a ceasefire, and no real end in sight for the turmoil that is plummeting markets.

Mar 092022,"A brush with death (cross)Wall Street starts to outrun the bears and leaps into the green at market open on Wednesday, despite a tumultuous Tuesday.🔍 Key points:Major U.S. indices opened sharply higher on Wednesday. The S&P 500 opened up 2.4%, the Nasdaq jumped nearly 3%, and the Dow was up over 2% – all three are snapping a four day losing streak, except for the Russell 2K, which was the only index to close Tuesday in the green and is up over 2% on Wednesday.It comes despite a ban on Russian oil from the U.S. and U.K. yesterday, which is sure to send oil and gas prices soaring to put extra pressure on inflation. Investors are possibly looking to news that Ukraine is no longer pursuing a NATO membership and is open to dialogue as a sign that a resolution could be on the way. It’s a massive relief to investors after the S&P 500 spent Tuesday flirting with a death cross, which historically means a correction could be on the way. That being said, the market is anything but predictable rn and all other indices have been dipping in and out of correction territory, so a recovery will likely depend more on external factors than technical ones.

Mar 082022,"Wall Street gets wiped outU.S. indices continue their march into the red on Tuesday morning as the pressure of war, proposed oil sanctions, and inflation continue to shake investors’ confidence. 🔍 Key points:Every major U.S. index is now in bear market territory. The S&P 500 had its worst day since October 2020 on Monday, sinking 2.95% and down a further 0.5% on Tuesday morning, the Dow dropped 2.37%, and the Nasdaq sank 3.75%. The U.S. is expected to ban imports of Russian oil as soon as today, which amounts to around 8% of all U.S. annual oil imports. Oil was sent spiking over 7% in Tuesday morning trading to flirt with the $130 mark as a result.Russia is responding to the proposed sanctions as badly as investors. Its deputy prime minister has warned that “a rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market” and claims it could easily send oil prices past $300 a barrel. He also added that Russia has every right to also cut off European gas if the U.S. makes good on its threats, which needless to say, would not bode well for the global economy.Ambrose Chua/ Unsplash"
Mar 022022,"More fear in the marketsAfter a solid start to the week, market sentiment shifted more towards fear as the effect of Russia’s invasion ripples around the world. Key points:Wall Street dipped back into the red on Tuesday. The S&P 500 lost 1.55%, the Dow (DJI) dumped 1.76%, the Nasdaq (NDX) sank 1.63%, and the Russell 2K (RUT) dropped 1.93% as the weakest link.Commodities are coming out on top though. Goldman Sachs Commodity Index closed at ten-year highs on Tuesday, now up 26.7% for the year. Energy was the only sector that spent Tuesday in the green, and oil popped past $110 in Wednesday morning trading – its highest level since summer 2014.Investors aren’t the only ones reacting to the crisis in Ukraine, with a number of big Western brands pulling back from Russia. Apple (AAPL) has suspended the sale of all its products in Russia, joining the likes of Nike (NKE), Ford (F), Boeing (BA), and Disney (DIS) in pulling back their involvement in the country to various degrees.

Feb 252022,"Wall Street’s back in the greenDespite starting the day down in the dumps, major U.S. indices make a healthy recovery on Thursday as investors looked beyond Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Key points:U.S. stocks turned things around on Thursday after major indices turned bearish earlier in the week. The S&P 500 gained 1.5% after starting the day down 2.6% (but is still in correction territory), the Nasdaq (NDX) closed up 3.3% after starting down 3.6%, and the Dow (DJI) added 0.28% after hitting a 2022 low in early trading. Russia has intensified its attack on Ukrainian troops, earning its economy a mountain of sanctions that could impact global markets. There are a couple of ways that could manifest, one of which is oil given Russia is the second-biggest global supplier – surging prices have the potential to impact consumer goods prices, fertilizer supply, and energy streams in the E.U. Investors bought the dip in some of tech’s biggest names, providing the strength to the overall market. Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet and Microsoft all closed higher by at least 4% and erased sharp declines from earlier in the day. However, Piper Sandler’s Craig Johnson isn’t sure that’s enough, saying the S&P 500 is “living on the edge of support”. lo lo / Unsplash"
Feb 232022,"The correction directionThe S&P 500 sinks into correction territory as markets continue their sell-off in light of the changing tone in Eastern Europe. Key points:The S&P 500 is now down over 10% from its January high, confirming a correction for the first time in nearly two years, the last of which came when covid crashed the market in 2020. There are macroeconomic and geopolitical factors at play, with most of the pressure coming from higher inflation, a hawkish Fed, and an escalation of tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Other indices are also on track to end the month in the red, with the Nasdaq (NDX) and the Dow (DJI) losing 0.99% and 1.42% respectively on Tuesday.A correction isn’t the end of the world historically – well, dating back to 1998 anyway. The index averages gains of 9.3% in the 12 months following a close in correction territory, so there’s still hope. Gage Skidmore / Wikimedia Commons"
Feb 162022,"Wall Street makes room for NFTsWall Street reverses three days of losses while a major exchange starts its NFT journey.Key points:Stocks jumped on Tuesday to reverse politically charged declines earlier in the week. The S&P 500 increased 1.58%, The Nasdaq (NDX) lifted 2.5% and the Dow (DJI) climbed 1.22% – all three enjoyed their best day of February so far, and stocks on the other side of the pond enjoyed similar gains. International political fears were somewhat allayed when Putin said he’d pull back troops from Ukraine, leading oil prices away from their seven-year high and other safe haven assets to slide. Elsewhere, the NYSE is trying to keep up with the cool kids. The major exchange has filed for a trademark for its very own digital asset marketplace, which will include NFTs and cryptocurrencies – it made a start on the market in April last year when it minted its own set of NFTs, but it’s upping its digital ambitions.

Feb 112022,"Inflation desperationWall Street dives down on Thursday after red-hot CPI data hits the stands. Key points:The stock market tumbled on Thursday, leaving the S&P 500 down 1.81%, the Nasdaq (NDX) lower 2.33% to be in the red for the week, and the Dow (DJI) down 1.47%. Consumer prices increased, again, pushing stocks into negative territory. The CPI rose another 0.6% in January, up 7.5% y-o-y for the fastest growth since 1982. Could the Fed be even more aggressive in its tightening after this? The market is already looking at a 0.25% rate hike in March, but now analysts think the first hike could be up to 0.5% or more – St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, for one, will be pushing full percentage increases going forward.

Feb 072022,"The S&P 500 stabilizesWall Street found its feet last week as it faced an onslaught of up and down earnings and a pleasantly surprising jobs report. Key points: Tech lifted the S&P 500 up 0.5% on Friday to end the week up 1.55% in its best week of the year, a milestone that the Nasdaq (NDX) joined in on with weekly gains of 1.66%. Stellar earnings from both Amazon (AMZN) and Snap (SNAP) helped buoy prices up after getting dunked into the red by Meta on Thursday – Amazon saw the biggest one day gain in market history.A better-than-expected January jobs report helped things along.

All the big indices ended Tuesday in the green. The S&P 500 lifted 0.69%, the Dow (DJI) was up 0.78%, and the Nasdaq (NDX) was up 0.75% – tech stocks led the recovery as earnings season delivered good news.  It comes despite U.S. debt topping $30tn for the first time ever, ringing in yet another sobering milestone for the country’s macro environment thanks to a jump in government borrowing during covid.  Analysts don’t think it's time to pop the champers just yet despite markets starting Feb on a strong note – Goldman Sachs added to a chorus of analyst pessimism with a warning that there could be another 10% downside on the way amid “classic bear market action”.Li Zhang / Unsplash"
Jan 272022,"JPow drops the mic (and the market)Fed Chair Jerome Powell took to the stage on Wednesday to give his audience an idea of what’s to come, but Wall Street isn’t sure it liked the show. The S&P 500 slid 0.15%, the Russell 2000 (RUT) lost 1.38%, and the Dow (DJI) dipped 0.38% – all three had a strong morning, but swiftly sank when Powell picked up the mic. He didn’t say anything too unexpected, but nobody likes the idea of paying interest. There will be three rate hikes this year, starting in March when the central bank will also halt its asset purchasing, and another three in 2023. The idea is to take inflation down to 3% by the end of the year (from 7% this December), but you know what they say about the best-laid plans…"
Jan 242022,"Exploring new post-pandemic lowsWall Street was man down! last week as earnings anxiety added to lingering Fed fears. The S&P 500 closed Friday down 1.9%. Both the Nasdaq (NDX) and the S&P 500 had their worst week since March 2020, sinking 7.5% and 5.7% respectively. 70% of the S&P 500 companies to report Q4 earnings have topped estimates so far, but a few big disappointments brought down the team – Netflix (NFLX) was Friday’s main culprit with losses of 22%.  The Fed’s first policy meeting of the year kicks off this week, and investors are anxiously waiting to get an idea about how much interest rates will be hiked and when it’ll start – dumping riskier assets in the meantime.Illustration by TradingView"

The S&P 500 closed up 0.08% on Friday after an absolute rollercoaster of a week that saw prices slowly lift and then lose over 2%. Retail sales dropped 1.9% in December, way more than the 0.1% drop people expected – a triple threat of inflation, parts shortages, and Omicron meant higher prices that sent home the spendthrifts.  Online shopping took the biggest hit of all apparently, dropping a whopping 8.7% for the month, but investors are hoping that upcoming rate hikes will remedy the situation.Fabio Bracht / Unsplash"
Jan 132022,"CPI highsThe market manages to steady itself despite inflation data coming in at a 40-year high. U.S. inflation is up 7% y-o-y in December. It basically measures how much we pay for stuff, and it’s the highest rate recorded since the broad-shoulder-padded era of 1982.  The increase was within expectations though, so the shockwaves were more like ripples and most main indices managed a day of modest gains – the red-hot reading was also likely already baked into prices from last week’s sell-off.  The Fed is on the case. It’s why they’re bringing in rate hikes and tighter monetary policy, and they’re confident the labor shortage will ease soon and help remedy things."
Jan 122022,"Powell pampers the marketPapa Powell soothes an unsettled market with a lullaby of measured monetary tightening.  The index gained 0.92% on Tuesday for its best day of 2022. We know it’s only the 12th, but after seeing losses nearly every other day, it’s a cause for celebration. Investors were scared of a “triple threat” (reducing bond buying, tapering, and increasing rates all at once), but Powell promised he is committed to keeping the economy balanced.  Earnings season is off to a good start. Of the 20 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, 70% have beat expectations. Can the market repeat Q3’s earnings success? Federalreserve / Flicker"

November’s jobs report paints a contradictory picture. While some are out looking for a secure investment, the Great Resignation is only getting worse, meaning people are also feeling secure enough to quit in pursuit of better paying jobs.

History suggests a repeat in 2022. A 71-year lookback by Truist Advisory Services found that if the S&P 500 returned at least 25% in a year, stocks also rose in the following year 82% of the time.But headwinds are still strong. The continually unpredictable pandemic combined with interest-rate increases on the horizon, means 2022 has some investors chewing their fingernails about what’s to come."

A bull run took prices to a new high of $4,807.02 on Tuesday after seeing gains of 5.23% in five sessions over the festive period.  The CDC cut its recommended isolation period for asymptomatic Covid cases, calming concerns that the new strain could take the economy back a few steps.

U.S. consumer prices increased by 6.8%, the biggest yearly jump since June 1982, having felt increased pressure from supply constraints.

Job openings increased to a whopping 11m from 431k, and the “great resignation” slowed down with 4.7% less job quitters. It’s not as exciting as it seems.

The S&P 500 closed last week up 1.33% after spending the entire month in the green, and the lift came despite a set of weaker than expected earnings from big tech giants Apple and Amazon. Both companies missed on revenue expectations for the third quarter, though the market seemed to shrug off the news as investors dived deeper into the reports and found the silver lining. The pair were also weighed down by supply chain shortages, which have also taken a toll on economic growth. Data came out on Thursday that also threatened to weaken the index – the economy has grown only 2% on an annualized basis for the third quarter, the lowest level since the COVID-induced recession in 2020 and down from 6.7% in the second quarter. Analysts were expecting growth of 2.7%, but external factors brought brought down the numbers, with Oxford Economics’ Gregory Daco saying:A resurgence of Covid infections cut the summer rebound in half while growing supply chain issues led to higher inflation and curbed demand.The S&P 500 soldiered on though, closing the week at an all-time high of $4,605.39.Dillon Kydd / Unsplash"

The downward trend was led by sharp losses from Visa (V), which lost nearly 7% on modest guidance; Robinhood (HOOD), which plummeted over 10% on lighter crypto trading; and General Motors (GM), which was driven down nearly 6% by earnings that felt the impact of the chip shortage. The bulls are still outweighing the bears despite the losses and chief market strategist for LPL Financial, Ryan Detrick, said:We see signs that there could be more gains to come in the final two months of the year.

The S&P 500 has been enjoying a winning streak of note this earnings season, boosted by stronger than expected reports over the last two weeks – of the 117 S&P 500 listed companies that have reported earnings for this quarter, nearly 84% have beaten analyst expectations. The index celebrated with gains of over 4.5% in seven sessions, one of its longest rallies yet and taking prices to their all time high of $4551.44 on Thursday. You know what they say though, what goes up must come down, and Friday saw prices slip 0.11 for its first day in the red since October 12. The excitement was reined in by Jerome Powell, chairman of the Fed, who on Friday said that the agency is on track to begin tapering its asset purchases soon, though he plans to hold off on raising rates for now. If the Fed goes ahead as planned, it's likely that the tapering process will be completed in the first half of 2022. Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Texas, said:Every time he (Powell) has been talking about tapering so far, markets haven't been bothered by it, but now at record highs investors tend to be just a little bit more sensitive to such news.Even in the face of that news though, the S&P 500 notched its third consecutive week of gains last week, and is now up over 5% for the month.lo lo / Unsplash"

So far so good though, and earnings so far have been strong enough to send the index on one of its longest winning streaks on record, up for six consecutive sessions. Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs, said:The reason we’re seeing this rally over the last week is that company earnings are looking really good. Most companies are managing inflationary pressures and pricing issues and that’s helping to alleviate concerns about overvaluation and inflation.There are still looming concerns over supply chain disruptions and the rising cost of materials, which could lead to higher prices for consumers and weakened economic recovery, but investors seem to be taking the obstacles in their stride. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said last week’s strong bank earnings kicked things off with a bang, and sees more gains on the way: That kicked off this rally. I think it’s a combination of earnings. It is month-over-month changes in inflation that looks like it is peaking out and the effect of the Covid variant is slowing down. History shows that stock market advances following the recovery from pullbacks recorded an average price gain of 8.4% over the following 98 calendar days before slipping into a new decline of 5% or more.

Consumer prices are up 5.4% for September, marking the fifth month in a row that inflation has seen an increase of 5% or more. The increase was just ahead of analyst expectations, so the market wasn’t blindsided, but prices still lost 0.39% in the first hour of trading. Traders were also digesting the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last meeting released on Wednesday, which confirm suspicions that a gradual bond tapering process will start around mid-November.

After spending nearly every month in the green this year, the S&P 500 has been on a losing streak since the start of September, losing over 4% since September 2 to close at $4,350.64 on Tuesday. Analysts are mixed regarding what the rest of the year holds, but Morgan Stanley says the chances of a strong correction will depend on what Q3 earnings have to say. Morgan Stanley strategists, led by Michael Wilson, wrote:The S&P 500's more erratic behavior since the beginning of September has coincided with the Fed's more aggressive pivot toward tapering of asset purchases. While the average stock has already experienced a 10-20% correction this year, the S&P 500 has avoided it, at least so far. As of today, that de-rating is about halfway done based on prior mid-cycle transitions.

No agreement had been reached yet, so there was a sigh of relief today when Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer accepted McConnell’s offer to raise the debt ceiling by $480 billion until December. White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said: The President looks forward to signing legislation to raise the debt limit when it is passed by Congress. This is a positive step forward.

There has been a lot of commotion within the market recently, largely sparked by challenges coming out of China like the Evergrande crisis and a ban on all cryptos, and things have been made worse by the weight of potential tapering from the Fed. As the U.S. economy recovers, investors are starting to worry about what a potential slowdown in bond purchasing could look like. Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at Forex.com, weighed in: The deep sell-off highlights the extent of the nerves in the markets surrounding the moves of the Fed.

The index took a hit of 1.7% on Monday as Chinese real estate giant Evergrande (3333) came close to causing some real economic instability in the region, causing ripple effects across world markets – but on Wednesday, the S&P 500 turned things around, and set off upwards for the rest of the week. China put pressure on the market again on Friday by banning crypto in all its forms, weighing down tech stocks everywhere, and Nike (NKE) brought down the team with losses of 11% on the back of a negative outlook, but the S&P trooped on in style to end the week up 0.51%. That’s probably partly thanks to a lack of dramatic news out of the Federal Reserve following its two-day quarterly meeting last week, which concluded on Wednesday by keeping interest rates anchored near zero. There is also no new information on the agency’s tapering timeline – though it’s expected to begin “soon” while interest rates could rise as soon as 2022. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, said: As bad as things started off on Monday for stocks, a mid-week bounce and calm on Friday isn’t so bad.

However, it says that tapering will begin “soon,” with plans to scale back asset purchases as early as November.

The S&P 500 has been dealing with an extended Labor Day hangover it seems, spending the week in the red as a couple of banks came out with predictions on what the rest of the year holds for the high-profile index – and opinions are pretty mixed. Earlier this week, Morgan Stanley (MS) predicted a correction of between 10% and 15% by the end of the year, saying the drop is “necessary to restore risk premiums and preserve forward returns”. The S&P 500 Index has been on the up-and-up this year, lifting over 20% since January and last week notching its 55th record closing high of the year – all without seeing a single drop of more than 5%.

BofA (BAC) also assigned a 2022 year-end target of 4,600 – up only 2% from current levels. UBS (UBS) is most optimistic of all, assigning the index the highest price target on Wall Street at 4.650. The bank cited a slow-down in COVID cases, impressive Q2 earnings, and increasing growth activity, and said: Equities are likely to sell off at some point in coming weeks as investors brace for higher yields, taxes, slowing data, etc. But peak growth does not mean a deep slowdown is imminent.The S&P 500 ended Thursday down 0.46% despite news that jobless claims fell to a near 18-month low, which should ease fears of slowing economic recovery; but got people worried that the Fed would be scaling back its accommodating pandemic-induced policies. Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, gave his two cents: There is likely to be a fierce debate at the coming Fed meeting on how tight the labor market is, but if policymakers focus on the most timely data we've got, they will realize that the labor market is close to meeting their more stringent criteria for an interest rate hike let alone the trigger for tapering."
